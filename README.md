# DTL_Reader

This is an App to read *.dtl & some *.evt files generated by some PLC devices, this format of data storage is not so famous, therefore it is hard to find any useful info in the Internet.

I have successfully wrote the tool to read such files and using it in one of my big projects. And now sharing the VB.NET code to others in case someone needed same.

If you have anything to say about the code - you are welcome for discussion.
